# Assignment 4 - Word Blast

Welcome to your fourth homework assignment.  

Again, code should be neat, well documented.  Variables should have meaningful names and be in a consistent format (I do not care if you use camelCase or under_scores in variables but be consistent.  In addition, each file should have a standard header as defined below.

```

This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment written in C.  You can (and should) work in groups to research how to do the assignment, but each person should code their own version and make their own submission.

For this assignment, your program is to read War and Peace (a text copy is included with this assignment) and it is to count and tally each of the words that are 6 or more characters long.  And again, you will only use Linux (not library) file functions, i.e. open, close, read, lseek.

BUT, it is to do this using threads.  Each thread will take a chunk of the file and process it, returning it’s results to the main which tallies (or if you directly tally to shared memory, that is okay) and then the main will print the ten, 6 or more character, words with the highest tallies, in order highest to lowest, and their associated counts.  i.e. The top ten words and the number of times that word appears in the text.

Your program should take two parameters on the command line:  FileName  and ThreadCount
- FileName is the name of the file to read – WarAndPeace.txt
- ThreadCount is the number of threads you should spawn to evenly divide the work.

That is to say – if the parameter is 1, the entire file would be read and processed by one thread.  If the parameter is 5, then you would divide the file into 5 equal parts (accounting for rounding on the last part).  So thread one would take the first 1/5 of the file, thread 2 the second fifth and so on.  But, these threads should all be launched together in a loop. So that they can execute in parallel.

#include <time.h> in your code and in main, include the code below in your main.  This will display how much time your program takes.  Your submission should include a run with 1 thread, 2 threads, 4 threads, and 8 threads.  How do the times compare?

```
    struct timespec startTime;
    struct timespec endTime;
    clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &startTime);

	<YOUR CODE IN MAIN HERE>

    clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &endTime);
	time_t sec = endTime.tv_sec - startTime.tv_sec;
	long n_sec = endTime.tv_nsec - startTime.tv_nsec;
	if (endTime.tv_nsec < startTime.tv_nsec)
		{
		--sec;
		n_sec = n_sec + 1000000000L;
		}

	printf("Total Time was %ld.%09ld seconds\n", sec, n_sec);
```
There is a template main with this code provided. (Don't forget to rename it to the naming conventions)

**Hints** Do not forget to protect critical sections.  Make sure you use thread safe library calls.  You will need to know how long the input file is, look up lseek.

**Important** There are a couple errors in the Makefile template.  So there is a new Makefile in this project that corrects the mistakes and adds pthread as a library that is needed when you build the application on Linux.

Do a short writeup in PDF format that includes a description of what you did and an analysis of the results.  Explain and reflect on why the times for the different runs are what they are, how does each run compare with the others.  Also include the compilation and execution output from your program in the writeup. Your execution output should include at least 4 runs, 1 thread, 2 threads, 4 threads, and 8 threads.   Submit all your source code file(s), Makefile and PDF writeup into GitHub.  The writeup (PDF) should also be submitted to iLearn.

Your main program filenames should be `<lastname>_<firstname>HW<#>_<optional>.<proper extension>`

**Sample Output**
```
gcc -o bierman_robert_HW4_main bierman_robert_HW4_main.o -g -I. -l pthread
./bierman_robert_HW4_main WarAndPeace.txt 4


Word Frequency Count on WarAndPeace.txt with 4 threads
Printing top 10 words 6 characters or more.
Number 1 is Pierre with a count of 1963
Number 2 is Prince with a count of 1928
Number 3 is Natásha with a count of 1212
Number 4 is Andrew with a count of 1143
Number 5 is himself with a count of 1020
Number 6 is princess with a count of 916
Number 7 is French with a count of 881
Number 8 is before with a count of 833
Number 9 is Rostóv with a count of 776
Number 10 is thought with a count of 767
Total Time was 1.938852743 seconds
```
